Description: Functions for analysing, estimating, 
             simulating and bootstrapping I(1) integrated time series 
             data in the framework of the Vector 
             Error-Correcting Model. The package seeks to facilitate
             the application of cointegration analysis using the 
             co-called Copenhagen approach. As such, the package contains
             large portions of overlapping functionality to the CATS in RATS
             package for cointegration analysis.
